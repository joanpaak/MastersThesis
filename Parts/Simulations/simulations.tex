\subsection{Linear regression with known variance}

When variance is known, the left side reduces to a constant. This does not affect where the maximum of the information gain function is reached. This means that the left side can be dropped.

The equation

\begin{equation}
	ig(x) = h \left(\int p(y) \right)  - \int h \Bigl( p(y) \Bigl)
\end{equation}

becomes

\begin{equation}
	ig(x) = h \left(\int p(y) \right)
\end{equation}

The distribution of p(y) is a mixture of normal distributions, and consequently its entropy can not be solved in closed dorm.
